## Hardcore Mode

- Toggle when creating a new account (check the Hardcore box)
- **On death:** your save file is permanently deleted and the client closes
- Logging in again starts a fresh character
- Back up your save file manually if you want a safety net

## Building from Source

**Requirements:** Java 17+, `lib/gson-2.6.2.jar` (included)

```bash
BUILD_DIR="build" && \
rm -rf "$BUILD_DIR" && \
mkdir -p "$BUILD_DIR" && \
find src -name '*.java' -print0 | xargs -0 javac -source 17 -target 17 -cp lib/gson-2.6.2.jar -d "$BUILD_DIR" && \
jar cfm "rsc.jar" META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -C "$BUILD_DIR" . && \
rm -rf "$BUILD_DIR"
```

This produces `rsc.jar` in the project root. The build command is also saved in `compile.txt`.
