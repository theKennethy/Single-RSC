After many years of study he developed a machine infused with magical power, that had the ability to pierce into the very heavens itself, a huge eye that gave the user sight like never before. As Time passed Scorpius grew adept at his skill, and followed the star movements themselves which he mapped and named, and are still used to this very day. Before long Scorpius used his knowledge for predicting the future and gaining dark knowledge. Years after his death, the plans of Scorpius were uncovered at an ancient Zamorakian worship site, and the heavenly eye was again constructed. Since then many have learned the ways of the Astrologer. Some claim his ghost still wanders ever seeking his master Zamorak, and will grant those adept in the arts of the Astrologer a blessing of power. Here ends the tale of how Astrology entered the known world.", true);
